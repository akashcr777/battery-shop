## 📝 What's in Each Folder

### `frontend/public/images/`
**Main image folder** - Paste all your images here!

**Required (8 category images):**
- battery-two-wheeler.jpg
- battery-three-wheeler.jpg
- battery-four-wheeler.jpg
- battery-truck.jpg
- battery-home.jpg
- ups-type1.jpg
- ups-type2.jpg
- ups-type3.jpg

**Optional (product-specific images):**

### `frontend/public/images/products/`
**Optional subfolder** - Use this if you want to keep product images organized separately

You can paste images in either location - the system finds them automatically!

## 💡 Tips

### Where to Paste Images

**Option 1: Simple (Recommended)**
```
images/
├── battery-two-wheeler.jpg     ← All images in main folder
├── battery-three-wheeler.jpg
├── exide-xplore-xltz4a-4ah.jpg
└── ... (all images together)
```

**Option 2: Organized**
```
images/
├── battery-two-wheeler.jpg     ← Category images
├── battery-three-wheeler.jpg
└── products/
    ├── exide-xplore-xltz4a-4ah.jpg  ← Product images
    └── apc-ups-600va.jpg
```

**Both work perfectly!** Choose what's easier for you.
